My contribution via copulas on regular R talks in Edinburgh

If you search the keyword **"copula"** in [Available CRAN Packages By Name](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html) you will see 

- 124 matches and
- around 83 related R packages including this keyword
- probably various exists in github or similar platforms also

There are **9 R packages** when you searched for **"vine copula"** instead, so R has a very rich ecosystem for bringing copula theory into life

## Main R packages for Copula analysis
